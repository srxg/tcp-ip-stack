# tcp-ip-stack
This is a Userspace TCP/IP stack (built from Layer 2 up) for Linux made purely for educational purposes.
I want to learn more about networking at a deeper level and following saminiir's tutorial seemed
liked a good way to do that.

## TUN/TAP devices
A Linux TAP device will be used to intercept low-level (data link) network traffic from the (Linux) kernel.

### What's a TUN/TAP Device?
They're just "kernel virtual network devices". They're supported entirely in software.
Used by *userspace applications* to manipulate L3/L2 traffic, respectively (network and data layers).
For example - tunneling (wrapping a packing inside the payload of another packet).

### Advantages
- We can set them up easily in userspace
- Already used in a large variety of programs, e.g. OpenVPN.

### TUN and TAP in the Network Stack
TUN and TAP can't be used together - they work (transmit and receive) at diferent layers of the network stack.
- **TUN**nel, simulates a device on the network layer. So, it carries IP packets in layer 3.
    - **TUN** is used with *routing*.
- **TAP** (network TAP) simulates a device on the data link layer. So, it carries Ethernet frames on Layer 2.
    - **TAP** can be used to create a network bridge in userspace.
    - A *network tap* is typically a *dedicated pice of hardware* which provides a way to access the data
      flowing across a network. It montiors events on a local network.
    - A *network tap* has >= 3 ports: Port A, B and a Monitor Port. A tap inserted between A and B passes
      all traffic (send and receive streams) through unimpeded in real time, but also copies the traffic
      to the monitor port. VoIP recording, Packet Sniffers, Network Intrusion Detection Systems, etc.

```
(3) Network Layer    <------ TUN ------>  Network Layer
(2) Data Link Layer  <------ TAP ------>  Data Link Layer
```

So, a TUN/TAP device is used by the OS to *send packets*.
These packets are delivered to a *program* in *userspace* which attaches itself to the device.
Such a program in userspace could also *pass packets* **into** a TUN/TAP device - in which case,
the TUN/TAP device delivers ("injects") these packets to the OS network stack
(i.e. emulating their reception from an external source).

Use cases : VPNs, Virtual-Machine Networking

Recap:
- **TUN** devices:
  - work at the **IP level** (this is on layer 3)
  - forwarding packets from the network layer (layer 3).
  - they appear to the system as if they were a **network interface card** (e.g. ethernet card or wifi nic)
    - **BUT** instead of sending packets to the physical network, they pass them to a **USERSPACE PROGRAM**.

- **TAP** Devices:
  - Work at the **ethernet level** (layer 2 - datalink layer).
  - They forward frames from the data link layer.
  - Useful for creating virtual network bridges.
    - E.g., you could connect a TAP device with a physical network device (like `eth0`) in a bridge, and then all traffic that comes over the physical device could be read by the program that has the **TAP** device open.
  
  - So, a Userspace program can then hence read packets from the TAP device just like it would read from a regular network 


### What's tunneling?
"the idea of carrying lower-layer traffic in higher-layer (or equal-layer) packets."
"For example, IPv4 can be carried in an IPv4 or IPv6 packet; Ethernet can be carried in a UDP or IPv4 or IPv6 packet, and so on."
So - to achieve this, we inject packets into the payload of other packets.

### Tunneling Protocols?
- Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE)
- Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
- Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

### The result of tunneling?
Virtual links between computers in different networks can be set up!
E.g. an company's private network can be accessed from the outside, public network via tunneling

**Tunneling *itself* does not guarantee secure communications**.

### MAC and Ethernet Frame Format
Media Access Control (MAC) protocol had to be incorporated to organise the data flow when ethernet was half duplex.
Even now, Carrier Sense, Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is required as the MAC method if running an Ethernet interface in half-duplex mode.

The 100BASE-T Ethernet standard used twisted-pair wiring to enable full duplex communication and higher throughput speeds.
