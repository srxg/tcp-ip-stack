// (block of data, containing formatted information - that is,

/**
 * 
Parsing : analysing a block of data (usually binary data received over a 
network or read from a file or a device)
          and extracting the information it contains into a structured format
          that the software can use.
          
          When you do something like struct eth_hdr *hdr = (struct eth_hdr*) buf;
          you're interpreting the block of data in buf as an eth_hdr structure,
          which involves parsing the data.

A portable, albeit slightly more laborious approach, would be to serialize the
protocol data manually. This way, the compiler is free to add padding bytes to
conform better to different processorâ€™s data alignment requirements.

 * struct eth_hdr serialise_protocol_data(unsigned char* buf) {
    struct eth_hdr hdr;
    int payload_length = 
    memcpy(hdr.dmac, buf, 6);
    buf+=6;
    memcpy(hdr.smac, buf, 6);
    buf+=6;

    hdr.ethertype = ntohs(*(uint16_t*)buf);
    buf+=2;

    if(hdr.ethertype >= ETH_P_802_3_MIN) {
        switch(hdr.ethertype) {
            case ETH_P_IP:
            {

            }
            case ETH_P_ARP:
            {

            }
            default:
            // somehow raise an error to show this is unsupported type?
        }
    } else {
        // contains length of it
    }
